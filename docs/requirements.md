# Requirements

- Note the responsive breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile web browsers.
- If you are familiar with Tailwind CSS and Next.js (we use App Router), please use those frameworks, otherwise use whatever is most productive.
- When a backend is needed to send/receive data, we suggest you mock that API rather than implement it.
- The focus should be on clean, functional code.
